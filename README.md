The 8 Queens problem is a challenge to position 8 queens onto a chess board where none of the 8 are in direct range of the other 8.
In chess a queen can move any distance horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, so to solve the 8 queens problem, each queen cannot be in the same row nor column.
Chess boards are 8x8 by standard, so that means that each row and each column will contain 1 queen, (Any more and the two queens in that row or column will conflict with eachother) and each queen must not be positioned in a shared diagonal with another queen.
